Introduction
============
Estado is a small java application that collects Hadoop job status including counters. Ultimate
goal is to collect all job statistics from all Hadoop clusters and collect them in a central 
repository for further analysis, dash board and alerting. Example of an alert might be certain 
counter exceeding some threshold.

Architecture
============
Estado should be setup as a cron job one for each cluster. it could run in any Hadoop node in
a given cluster. 

There is a pluggable status consumer, that consumes status data and does whatever it wants to do.
Typically, the consumer will write the status data in one central database, so that all Hadoop job
status data is consolidated in one place.

There is a default JobStatusConsoleConsumer class already included, that simply writes the data to 
console. In future, I will provide pluggable consumers for file and RDBMS.

Configuration
=============
The configuration is very simple. Here is an example.

cluster.name=default
status.filter=srfpk
consumer.console.class=org.estado.spi.JobStatusConsoleConsumer

Each hadoop cluster should be given an unique name. The filter parameter provides a list of job statuses
to be used as filter, where s=succedded r=running f=failed p=preparing and k=killed

The last line provides the consumer class name. The second component of the property
name is a name (e.g., console) for the consumer. Some consumers may need additional parameters. Here is 
an example for a file consumer.

consumer.file.class=org.estado.spi.JobStatusFileConsumer
consumer.file.name=/var/log/estado.log

Sample Output
=============
Here is some sample output for console consumer.
